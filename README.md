There are dozens of open-source shopping cart programs available, but none come close to the options, features and stability available with Zen CartÂ®.

And as for the commercial programs, watch as the fees ramp up to match your sales! At some point you'll jump ship, so why not start with an unrestricted solution?

## Why not to use Zen Cart Shopping Cart software for your business?

Zen Cart is open-source: it is licensed under GPL2, meaning you are free to modify the source code however you like. However, this freedom to customize the functionality and behavior can be overpowering. It can be your DIY solution or you can contract any php-mysql developer.

This extends to the visual side of Zen Cart, it includes a responsive template. A Bootstrap 4 template is maintained under constant development to provide a minimalist framework that is standards and accessibility-compliant far in excess of any other cart, but maybe not so visually exciting.

Zen Cart is function over form, but you always have the freedom to add or change whatever you wish.

If you want a hands-off experience but also enjoy waiting for some online support person to fix your site when they break it with silent "upgrades" that they haven't done, Zen Cart is not for you.

## What do I need to use Zen Cart?

The lowest level hosting solution that offers a mysql database is usually sufficient to get started. Maybe your hosting even includes a Zen Cart one-click auto-install for you to try (which is ok for a tryout but never to develop).

Or, install it on your local computer (requires a web server).
